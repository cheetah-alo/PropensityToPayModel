    "The intended target for prediction is `ct090`, `case_id` is the unique identifier, `keydate` is the point in time when some event has happened in the lifecycle of a case, and also a date relative to which all of the backward looking variables and forward looking targets are calculated. In this case, it's a general purpose propensity to pay model, which means that it is a freshly registered case, where all the relevant data has been gathered and verified. In other words, `keydate` is set a few days after registration, and target `ct090` is checking for outcome in 90 days (`ap090` is a similar regression target), while all the rest of the data is only looking backwards!\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata gives some basic description of variables. The general naming convention is based on prefixes that define aggregation levels - `cXXXX` looking at the data of this case only, `dXXXX` looking at other cases of same debtor, `bXXXX` looking at all cases of the debtor, `aXXXX` looking at all the cases on the same address. This is not very relevant for this particular task, but gives some idea of our data setup here in Intrum! Note that this data selection has quite a few variables with the `dXXXX` prefix, which means that this selection is specifically looking at debtors that we already had worked with before, therefore, variable selection is much broader and models are generally better. \n",
    "\n",
    "One more tip on interpretation of missing values: if variable is bound by time window, e.g. `d2112 NumberOfCustomerPaymentsInLast12Months`, the `NA` value implies that there never have been any values, while `0` would mean that have been no values within bounding period (in this case 12 months). In other words, `0` and `NA` have different interpretation. It may or may not be relevant, depending on the choice of the modelling approach. \n",

    "### Some tips on the task\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no end to seeking the perfection, and countless ways to approach this task. However, try not to approach this like a competition to crank out the highest possible accuracy metrics. What matters is the sequence and thought process - show this in illustrations and comments! Even if certain things might take too long to implement in a code, but you have a good idea where to go with this - write down your ideas! This is what matters. Generally, try not to spend more than a few hours on this.\n",
